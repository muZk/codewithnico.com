excerpt: When you start, there are various function styles thrown around‚Ä¶ Which one should you use?
---

In React world, developers thrown around various function styles. For example:

```jsx
const Text1 = (props) => (
  <div>{props.message}</div>
);

const Text2 = ({ message }) => (
  <div>{message}</div>
);

function Text3(props) {
  return <div>{props.message}</div>
}

function Text4({ message }) {
  return <div>{message}</div>
}
```

Took from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fvd0h9/what_style_of_functions_do_you_prefer_to_use_in/) 
Which one is better? Which one should you use?

Quick answer: the four are equivalent.

As stated in this [discussion on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/996710899921686528), at the end of the day it doesn't matter and **it is more of a personal preference.**

What is important is to **stick with one** when building an application. This way:

- Your code will be easier to read because it use the same convention everywhere
- You will focus on building the app instead of thinking about how to write your components.
- You won't confuse the person who read the code (could be you!) by writing similar code in different ways.

## My personal preference

I use named functions with [destructed props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) to define my components:

```jsx
function Text4({ message }) {
  return <div>{message}</div>
}
```

My personal preference: named function with destructured props

Why this style? Let's compare with alternatives:

### function vs const

When using a const, I read it as ‚Äú*I'm defining an anonymous function and storing it in a variable*‚Äù. While with a function it's like ‚Äú*here is a function*‚Äù.

It is longer to type but it is easier to read.

### Destructed props

What I like about destructed props is that I know what are the accepted props *as I read the component.* I know this is not a strong argument, since there are other ways to do it. But this is the easier üòá

### How to be consistent without thinking about it

> *‚ÄúI want to write code. Not spend cycles on formatting.‚Äù*

There are tools that help to maintain the same code convention in our code ü•∞ 

In JavaScript world, the most popular is [Prettier](https://prettier.io) which is an *opinionated code formatter.* It means that when you click ‚Äúsave‚Äù, it updates your code to follow certain rules üßô
