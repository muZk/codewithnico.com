I'm NicolÃ¡s, I am a software developer with 6+ years of experience building web applications. My last two years has been heavily focused on JavaScript technologies such as React and Node.

### What is this site about?

My goal is to help developers level up their careers by sharing my experience in building **production ready** applications with ReactJS.

Some applications I'm proud of and that are still alive:

- [Cupcake](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cupcake-2): App to keep track of your friends' birthdays! ðŸŽ‚ Built with React Native and Firebase.
- [Say Hi](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/sayhi): Chrome extension to stay in touch with your distributed team (in a fun way! ðŸ˜Š) Built with React and AWS serverless tools.

So if you have any question about building applications in React, you can reach me on [Twitter as @codewithnico](https://twitter.com/codewithnico).
